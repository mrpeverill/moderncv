This was a stab at creating a resume in LaTeX using moderncv. My advice is not to do this unless you know a lot about LaTeX already. I found that some sections were not formatted that well because I didn't want to make a custom record type for each sort of entry. Also, I drew up short in making a references list with my name bolded, in APA style, with reverse numbered references.
